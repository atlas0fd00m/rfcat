/*************************************************************************************************
 * welcome to the cc1111usb application.
 * this lib was designed to be the basis for your usb-app on the cc1111 radio.  hack fun!
 *
 * 
 * best way to start is to look over the library and get a little familiar with it.
 * next, put code as follows:
 * * any initialization code that should happen at power up goes in appMainInit()
 * * the main application loop code should go in appMainLoop()
 * * usb interface code should go into appHandleEP5.  this includes a switch statement for any 
 *      verbs you want to create between the client on this firmware.
 *
 * if you should need to change anything about the USB descriptors, do your homework!  particularly
 * keep in mind, if you change the IN or OUT max packetsize, you *must* change it in the 
 * EPx_MAX_PACKET_SIZE define, the descriptor definition (be sure to get the right one!) and should 
 * correspond to the setting of MAXI and MAXO.
 * 
 * */
