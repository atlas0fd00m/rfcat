RfCat MSF Relay
===============

The RfCat MSF Relay is a lightweight webserver that provides
Metasploit Hardware Bridge support.  Many of the python methods
are available interfactive from either the Metasploit hwbridge
interactive shell or from Metasploit modules written to support
the rftransceiver extension.

For details on the RFTransceiver extension API see:
http://OpenGarages.org/hwbridge

To download Metasploit: https://www.metasploit.com/

Usage
=====

With a RfCat compatible device plugged into a machine (ie YardStickOne)
run rfcat_msfrelay.  It will start a webserver and report

  RfCat MSFRelay running.

By default it only listens to localhost and has a default username:password
of msf_relay:rfcat_relaypass.  All of these options can be altered via
command line arguments for rfcat_msfrelay.  Once running can launch Metasploit.

```
./msfconsole -q 
msf > use auxiliary/client/hwbridge/connect 
msf auxiliary(connect) > set httpusername msf_relay
httpusername => msf_relay
msf auxiliary(connect) > set httppassword rfcat_relaypass
httppassword => rfcat_relaypass
msf auxiliary(connect) > run

Notes
=====
Not all methods have been ported to Metasploit.  The typical workflow
is to do your initial research via rfcat and use Metasploit just
for the results of that research.  Metasploit works better as an
exploit framework than a research framework.  However, if you feel
that there are some useful methods missing that you would want to see,
please file an issue on the Metasploit github page:
